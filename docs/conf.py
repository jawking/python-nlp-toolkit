# -- Hack for ReadTheDocs ------------------------------------------------------
# This hack is necessary since RTD does not issue `sphinx-apidoc` before running
# `sphinx-build -b html . _build/html`. See Issue:
# https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues/1139
# DON'T FORGET: Check the box "Install your project inside a virtualenv using
# setup.py install" in the RTD Advanced Settin
